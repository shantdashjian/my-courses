## ‚ö° Motivation
I deeply enjoy programming and teaching. Since 2023, I taught at [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home?coupon=SHANT50), the popular web development learning platform. During this time, I taught various topics in web development and AI. This includes teaching how to build AI-powered applications with Claude AI, how to use build tools like Vite, and how to test React applications with Vitest, React Testing Library, and Mock Service Worker.
